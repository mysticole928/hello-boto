# hello-boto

I've got a project in mind that use AWS.  However, most of docs seem to be written for experienced developers.  This repo will be for my Python/Boto3 things.

So, as I learn how to make magic happen, I'll put code snippets here.

As an FYI, as to why I've started this repo, I've got some data in text files that I want to parse and put into DynamoDB.  I know how to open files on my local system but don't know much about coding for the cloud.  (I'm more of an infrastructure person.)

I'm new to git/git-hub too.  So, if there's a better, faster, stronger way, please ping me.
