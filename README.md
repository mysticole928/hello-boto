# hello-boto

I've got some projects in mind that use AWS.  However, most of docs seem to be written for experienced developers.  

This repo will be for my Python/Boto3 things.  So, as I learn how to make magic happen, I'll put code snippets here.

I'm new to git/git-hub too.  If there's a better, faster, stronger way two refactor the code here, please ping me.
